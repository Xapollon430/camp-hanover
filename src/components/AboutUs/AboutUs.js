        <h1>About Camp Hanover</h1>
        <p>
          There is a growing need for personal connection in today's world. In
          an age of cell phones, email and social networks, we are in touch with
          more people than ever but have fewer significant face-to-face
          relationships with others. In a society where we rush from one
          engagement to another, we rarely pause to smell the earth, soak in its
          colors, or feel the grass beneath our feet. In a culture of efficiency
          and multi tasking, we check off urgent matters from our “to-do list”
          and often miss the most important things, like relationships…
          Relationships with others, with family, and with friends. Camp Hanover
          offers that opportunity to rekindle these relationships in a sacred
          space for renewal and growth.

        <h1>What We Do...</h1>
        <p>
          Our mission is to provide a place apart for renewal and growth in an
          environment of Christian hospitality. To these ends, Camp Hanover
          provides opportunities for meaningful fellowship, learning, service
          and growth through programs, facilities and outreach. Camp Hanover is…
          A Summer Camp where youth in elementary, middle and high school
          experience an atmosphere of caring and acceptance at every turn,
          learning to live, work, play, laugh and worship together in Christian
          community. A 600-acre Retreat Center where groups are invited to
          connect, refresh, renew, and grow, all year long. Guests to Camp
          Hanover will enjoy comfortable lodging, hearty meals and an atmosphere
          of radical, uncompromising hospitality.
