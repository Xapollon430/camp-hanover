      <h3>Camp Hanover Press Release</h3>
      <p>
        Hey Campers! We have some very exciting news to share with the Camp
        Hanover community that will affect our way of living and thriving as the
        Camp Hanover family. Recently, as the camp staff and affiliates, we have
        come up with new ways of functioning to promote the growth and quality
        of our lovely camp.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are glad to announce that we are changing our website and its
        contents to promote a more diverse and inclusive camp place for all
        kinds of campers from different backgrounds. Even though Camp Hanover
        will always be a Christian centered camp at heart, we decided to
        renovate and redesign our website in a way that conveys to new
        prospective campers that we are an inclusive camp that does not
        discriminate and ostracize people that are not of Christian faith. Our
        main goal will always be to build a community of trust, openness,
        sharing, and forgiveness. That is why in this regard we decided to
        remove some contents from our website that could have led prospective
        campers to believe that we are a Christian only camp.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also would like to bring new campers in from different places of
        Virginia, after making changes to our website, we also recognized that
        we need to reach out to people who are of different backgrounds whether
        it is religious, race, sex, and others. To see campers from different
        diversities we are deciding to advertise Camp Hanover, and with our new
        philosophy, to communities in Northern Virginia, Washington DC, and
        nearby diverse places. We hope you are as excited as us to see new
        campers starting this summer.
